# MPX68K

A Sharp X68000 computer emulator for macOS platforms, based on the px68k emulator core.
This repository is indirectly a fork of Mr. Hissorii's [px68k](https://github.com/hissorii/px68k). Based on that source code, [Goroman](https://github.com/GOROman) converted it for iOS, and [YosAwed](https://github.com/YosAwed) adapted it for macOS.

## Overview

MPX68K provides authentic Sharp X68000 emulation with modern Swift UI frameworks, bridging low-level C emulation code with SpriteKit for an optimal user experience on both Apple Silicon and Intel Macs.

## Changes in This Fork

This fork adds the following audio and MIDI features on top of the upstream
MPX68K repository:

- **Dual MIDI output**: CoreMIDI OUT-A and RS-232C MIDI OUT-B can be selected
  independently. MIDI IN is not connected yet.
- **Optional Audio Unit instruments**: Install a MIDI-capable macOS Music
  Device Audio Unit, open **MPX68K → MIDI & Audio Unit…**, press **Refresh**,
  select the instrument, and enable **Use Audio Unit**. The panel also opens
  the instrument's custom UI and controls its output gain. The built-in
  emulator audio remains active in parallel.
- **ymfm YM2151 audio**: The active FM generator uses the pinned
  `third_party/ymfm` submodule and adapts its output to the host audio device
  rate.
- **Low-latency built-in audio**: Direct HAL AudioUnit rendering is available
  as the asynchronous low-latency path, with AudioQueue retained for
  compatibility. The buffer-size setting supports 16, 32, 64 (default), 128,
  256, and 512 frames.
- **Live audio source level controls**: Independent built-in FM and ADPCM
  trims are available from -24 dB to +24 dB in 0.5 dB steps. The hosted Audio
  Unit synth has a separate output volume from -60 dB to 0 dB in 0.5 dB steps.
  Volume changes apply immediately and are saved between launches; for
  example, ADPCM -6 dB and FM +6 dB can be selected directly in the settings
  panel.

- 1GB free disk space for ROM and disk images

## ROM Files Setup

MPX68K requires original SHARP X68000 system ROM files to function properly. These files are **not included** with the emulator and must be obtained separately.

### Required ROM Files

You need the following ROM files from an original X68000 system:

| File | Description | Size | Required |
|------|-------------|------|----------|
| `CGROM.DAT` | Character Generator ROM | 768KB | Yes |
| `IPLROM.DAT` | Initial Program Loader ROM | 128KB | Yes |
| `IPLROM0.DAT` | SASI-era IPL ROM (used when Storage Bus Mode = SASI) | 128KB | Optional |
| `SCSIEXROM.DAT` | External SCSI ROM (CZ-6BS1 compatible, used when Storage Bus Mode = SCSI) | 8KB | Optional (required for authentic SCSI boot) |

> **Note on SCSI ROM variants**: Only the *external* SCSI ROM (`SCSIEXROM.DAT`, "SCSIEX" type) is supported. The internal SCSI ROM (`SCSIINROM.DAT`, "SCSIIN" type) has an incompatible IOCS table layout and will not work.

### Installation Locations

Place the ROM files in the sandboxed Documents folder:

```
~/Library/Containers/NANKIN.X68000/Data/Documents/X68000/
├── README.txt          (auto-generated on first launch)
├── CGROM.DAT           (required)
├── IPLROM.DAT          (required)
├── IPLROM0.DAT         (optional — SASI IPL)
└── SCSIEXROM.DAT       (optional — external SCSI ROM)
```

### Important Notes

- **Legal Notice**: ROM files are copyrighted by SHARP CORPORATION. You must own an original X68000 system to legally use these files.
- **File Names**: ROM file names are matched exactly as shown above (case-sensitive on some file systems).
- **File Integrity**: Ensure ROM files are not corrupted. The emulator will display an error if required files are missing or invalid.
- **Backup**: Always keep backup copies of your ROM files in a safe location.

### Verification

When ROM files are properly installed, the emulator will:
1. Load without ROM-related error messages
2. Display the characteristic X68000 boot screen
3. Show proper Japanese character rendering

If you see garbled text or boot failures, verify that your ROM files are correctly placed and named.

## Installation

### Building from Source
You need Apple Developer Account for using XCode and certification.

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/YosAwed/MPX68K.git
   cd MPX68K
   ```

   If the repository was cloned without `--recurse-submodules`, initialize the
   bundled ymfm source before opening Xcode:
   ```bash
   git submodule update --init --recursive
   ```

2. **Open in Xcode:**
   ```bash
   open X68000.xcodeproj
   ```

3. **Build the project:**
   - Select your target platform (macOS)
   - Build and run (⌘+R)

### Dependencies
The project includes the c68k CPU emulator and the ymfm YM2151 core. c68k is
built automatically by the Xcode project; ymfm is pinned as the
`third_party/ymfm` git submodule and must be initialized before building.

## Usage

### macOS Menu Reference

#### MPX68K Menu
- **MIDI & Audio Unit…**: Install a MIDI-capable macOS Music Device Audio Unit, press **Refresh**, then select it under **Instrument** and enable **Use Audio Unit**. The panel also provides the instrument's output gain, opens its custom UI, and configures the built-in YM2151 render path and audio buffer size.

#### FDD Menu

The MIDI & Audio Unit panel keeps the emulator audio active while optionally hosting a macOS Music Device Audio Unit in parallel. CoreMIDI is OUT-A; RS-232C is OUT-B and uses a selected `/dev/cu.*` or `/dev/tty.*` device at MIDI's 31,250 baud, 8-N-1 framing. MIDI events retain their host-clock timing through the parser, and CoreMIDI/AU scheduling uses a shared look-ahead timeline. Built-in YM2151 audio is adapted to match the host device rate; Direct AudioUnit is the low-latency asynchronous path, while AudioQueue is available for compatibility. MIDI IN is not connected yet.

#### Joycard Input
- **Arrow Keys** or **WASD**: 8-direction movement
- **Space** or **J**: Button A
- **Z** or **K**: Button B

## Machine Monitor Socket

The Machine Monitor socket exposes the emulator's internal state over a UNIX domain socket, allowing external tools (scripts, test harnesses, debuggers) to pause/resume emulation, read and write memory, inspect CPU registers, and hot-swap disk images — all without using the GUI.

The socket is **disabled by default**. To enable it, set the `monitorSocketEnabled` user default before launching the app:

```bash
defaults write NANKIN.X68000 monitorSocketEnabled -bool YES
```

To disable it again:

```bash
defaults delete NANKIN.X68000 monitorSocketEnabled
```

When enabled, the socket is created at launch with mode `0600` and removed on quit. The default path is `$HOME/mpx68k_monitor.sock`; for a sandboxed app, `$HOME` is the app container's `Data` directory. Set `MPX68K_MONITOR_SOCK` in the launch environment to override it. A log line confirms the resolved path:
```text
[MPX68K] Machine Monitor socket: /Users/name/Library/Containers/NANKIN.X68000/Data/mpx68k_monitor.sock
```

### Protocol

The protocol is line-oriented UTF-8 over a streaming UNIX socket.  Each request is one `\n`-terminated line; each response ends with `OK` on success or `ERROR <message>` on failure.

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `DIAG` | Read a boot-state snapshot without pausing |
| `PAUSE` | Pause emulation (required before writes) |
| `RESUME` | Resume emulation |
| `STATUS` | Returns `PAUSED` or `RUNNING` |
| `REGS` | Dump D0–D7, A0–A7, PC, SR (hex) |
| `SETPC <addr>` | Set PC (requires `PAUSE`) |
| `SETD/SETA <n> <val>` | Set a data/address register (requires `PAUSE`) |
| `SETSR <val>` | Set SR (requires `PAUSE`) |
| `TRACE [n]` | Step instructions and print PC/opcode (requires `PAUSE`) |
| `TRACER [n]` | `TRACE` with D0/D1/A0/A1 (requires `PAUSE`) |
| `STEPTO <pc> [maxsteps]` | Step until PC reaches the target or limit (requires `PAUSE`) |
| `READ <addr> <n>` | Hex-dump `n` bytes starting at `addr` |
| `READB/READW/READD <addr>` | Read byte / 16-bit word / 32-bit dword |
| `WRITE <addr> <b0> [b1…]` | Write bytes (requires `PAUSE`) |
| `WRITEW/WRITED <addr> <val>` | Write word / dword (requires `PAUSE`) |
| `HW [section]` | Hardware state snapshot |
| `MOUNTFDD <drive> <path>` | Hot-swap a disk image into FDD 0 or 1 |
| `EJECTFDD <drive>` | Eject image from FDD 0 or 1 |
| `QUIT` | Close connection |

All addresses and values are hexadecimal.  A simple session:

```console
$ nc -U /Users/name/Library/Containers/NANKIN.X68000/Data/mpx68k_monitor.sock
PAUSE
OK
READD 00ed0018
00000080
OK
RESUME
OK
QUIT
OK
```

The server handles one client at a time. `DIAG` reads a synchronized snapshot while emulation runs; commands that access live CPU, memory, or device state require `PAUSE` first to avoid data races.

### FDD disk swapping

`MOUNTFDD` and `EJECTFDD` let scripts swap floppy images into either drive without touching the GUI — useful for automating multi-disk games or running test suites that need different disk images across test cases.  The drive number is `0` or `1`; the path is an absolute path to any disk image format supported by the emulator (`.dim`, `.xdf`, `.2hd`, `.d88`, `.hdm`):

```text
MOUNTFDD 0 /Users/you/Documents/X68000/disk1.xdf
OK
EJECTFDD 0
OK
```

### Building with Socket Support

The socket server is compiled into `X68000 Shared/px68k/x11/winx68k.cpp`, which is already part of the "X68000 macOS" target.  No additional build steps are required — just build the project normally after enabling the feature via `defaults write`.

## File Formats

| Extension | Description | Type | Notes |
|-----------|-------------|------|-------|
| `.dim` | Standard disk image | Floppy | Most common X68000 format |
| `.xdf` | Extended disk format | Floppy | Extended capacity |
| `.2hd` | Raw 2HD disk image | Floppy | Loaded as an XDF-compatible raw image |
| `.d88` | D88 disk image | Floppy | Common retro-emulator format |
| `.hdm` | Human68k disk image | Floppy | Legacy Human68k format |
| `.hdf` | Generic hard disk image | Hard Disk | SASI / generic HDD |
| `.hds` | SCSI hard disk image | Hard Disk | SCSI HDD — auto-switches Storage Bus Mode to SCSI on open / drop |

### Hard Disk Usage

Hard disk images provide faster access and larger storage capacity compared to floppy disks:
You can make HDD image using this application, but it requires initialization by using FORMAT.X running by Human68k on the emulator.

1. **Loading HDD Images**: Use **HDD → Open Hard Disk...** menu or drag `.hdf` / `.hds` files
2. **Performance**: HDDs offer significantly faster loading times for large applications
3. **Capacity**: Support for larger disk images suitable for complex software suites
4. **Persistence**: Use **HDD → Save HDD** (⌘S) to flush the in-memory HDD image back to disk

#### Boot Order Behavior
Unlike many emulators, MPX68K reproduces the authentic X68000 boot sequence, which is **not** simply "FDD always wins." The boot device is selected by the SRAM byte `$ED0018` — the same byte that `SWITCH.X` writes on real hardware — and MPX68K preserves whatever value you last saved. The concrete rules are:

1. **SASI mode, default SRAM (`$ED0018 = $00`, a.k.a. `STD` in SWITCH.X)**:
   - FDD Drive 0 is checked first. If a bootable floppy is inserted, it boots from FDD.
   - Otherwise, the system falls back to the SASI HDD.
2. **SASI mode, SRAM set to HDD boot (`$ED0018 = $80`, e.g. after running `SWITCH.X` → Boot Device = `HD`)**:
   - The HDD boots first even if a floppy is inserted in Drive 0. This is authentic X68000 behavior — if your HDD isn't booting when you expect the FDD to take over, check `SWITCH.X`.
   - Safety net: if the SASI image has no valid boot sector, MPX68K automatically falls back to FDD boot for that reset (logged as *"SASI boot bypass"*).
3. **SCSI mode (Storage Bus Mode → SCSI)**:
   - On reset, MPX68K forces `$ED0018 = $80` so the SCSI HDD takes priority. The IPL ROM runs its normal init and `SCSI_InjectBoot` intercepts at the right moment to hand off to the SCSI device driver.
   - If you want to boot a floppy in SCSI mode, you need to switch **Storage Bus Mode → SASI** first (or eject the SCSI device).

MPX68K keeps the SASI-mode SRAM state across resets (`"SASI SRAM restored (SWITCH.X preserved)"` in the log), so you only need to run `SWITCH.X` once to configure boot priority.

#### Recommended Usage
- **System Boot from HDD**: Run `SWITCH.X` once inside Human68k and set the Boot Device to `HD`, then reboot. From that point the HDD will boot automatically.
- **Applications**: Store large software packages on HDD
- **Development**: Use HDD for compilers and development tools
- **Games**: Multi-disk games can be consolidated onto HDD
- **Boot Override**: With `$ED0018 = $00` (SWITCH.X = `STD`), insert a system floppy in Drive 0 to boot from FDD even when an HDD is mounted

### Screen Rotation (Tate Mode)

The X68000 emulator supports 90-degree screen rotation for vertical games, commonly known as "tate mode":

#### Supported Games
- **Dragon Spirit**: Classic vertical shooter requiring portrait orientation
- **Other Vertical Games**: Any X68000 game designed for vertical play

#### Usage
1. **Rotate Screen**: Use **Display → Rotate Screen** (⌘R) to toggle between orientations
2. **Direct Selection**: Choose **Display → Portrait Mode** for vertical games
3. **Window Adjustment**: macOS automatically resizes the window for optimal display
4. **Control Consistency**: Joycard controls remain unchanged regardless of rotation

#### Technical Features
- **Smooth Rotation**: SpriteKit-based rotation with proper aspect ratio maintenance
- **Persistent Settings**: Rotation preference is saved and restored between sessions
- **Optimal Scaling**: Automatic scaling ensures games fill the available screen space
- **No Performance Impact**: Rotation processing doesn't affect emulation performance

## Architecture

MPX68K uses a multi-layered architecture that bridges modern Swift UI frameworks with low-level C/C++ emulation code.

### Language Stack
- **Swift**: UI layer, device management, file system, logging infrastructure
